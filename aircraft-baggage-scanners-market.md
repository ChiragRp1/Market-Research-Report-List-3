<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Baggage Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-ray</li><li>Millimeter Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft baggage scanners come in two main types: X-ray scanners and millimeter wave scanners. X-ray scanners use high-energy electromagnetic radiation to penetrate luggage and create an image based on the materials inside. Millimeter wave scanners use non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation to detect objects concealed within baggage by measuring the reflected waves. Both types of scanners offer efficient and reliable security screening for airports and other transportation facilities. The decision on which type to use depends on factors such as cost, effectiveness, and regulatory requirements.</p></p>
