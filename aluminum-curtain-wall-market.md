<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Curtain Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-unitized</li><li>Unitized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum curtain wall systems are typically classified into two main types: semi-unitized and unitized. Semi-unitized systems involve assembling components on-site, with the framework installed first followed by the glazing elements. This type allows for more flexibility in design but may require more labor during installation. On the other hand, unitized systems are pre-assembled in a factory setting, with entire sections of the curtain wall being transported and installed as a single unit. This type can offer faster installation times and higher precision but may be less adaptable to design changes.</p></p>
