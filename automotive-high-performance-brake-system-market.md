<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive High-Performance Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc brakes</li><li>Drum brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive high-performance brake systems are divided into two main types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor to slow down or stop a vehicle, providing improved heat dissipation and better performance under heavy braking. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes that press against the inner surface of a drum to slow down the vehicle, offering simpler construction and lower cost. Both types have their own advantages and are commonly used in various vehicles.</p></p>
