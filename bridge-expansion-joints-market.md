<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Joints</li><li>Closed Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge expansion joints are an essential component in bridge construction that allow for the movement and expansion of the bridge structure while maintaining its integrity. There are two main types of bridge expansion joints: open joints and closed joints. Open joints are typically used in shorter spans and allow for both vertical and horizontal movement, as well as rotation. Closed joints, on the other hand, are used in longer spans and allow only for vertical movement. Both types of joints serve to prevent damage and ensure the safety and durability of the bridge structure.</p></p>
