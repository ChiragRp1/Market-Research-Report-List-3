<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Metal-Clad Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Armored</li><li>Non-Armored</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Copper Metal-Clad Cable market can be categorized into two main types: Armored and Non-Armored. Armored cables are designed with an additional protective layer of armor, typically made of steel, that provides extra protection against physical damage and external elements. Non-Armored cables, on the other hand, do not have this extra layer of protection and are generally used in more controlled environments where the risk of damage is lower. Both types of cables offer their own advantages and are chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
