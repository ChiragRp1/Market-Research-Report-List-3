<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion-Resistant Fiberglass Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Pumps</li><li>Vertical Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The corrosion-resistant fiberglass pumps market includes two main types: horizontal pumps and vertical pumps. Horizontal pumps are designed to move fluids horizontally, with the axis of the pump being parallel to the ground. These pumps are commonly used in applications where space is limited. On the other hand, vertical pumps are designed to move fluids vertically, with the axis of the pump being perpendicular to the ground. These pumps are often used in applications where a deep well or sump requires fluid to be lifted to the surface. Both types of pumps are made from fiberglass materials to provide corrosion resistance and durability.</p></p>
