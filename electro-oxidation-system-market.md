<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro-oxidation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Electrolytic Oxidation</li><li>Indirect Electrolytic Oxidation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electro-oxidation systems are categorized into two main types: direct electrolytic oxidation and indirect electrolytic oxidation. In direct electrolytic oxidation, the target pollutant is directly oxidized at the anode through the application of an electric current. On the other hand, indirect electrolytic oxidation involves the generation of oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals at the anode, which then react with the pollutants in the solution. Both systems are effective in treating wastewater and removing contaminants through the process of electrochemical oxidation.</p></p>
