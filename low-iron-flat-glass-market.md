<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Iron Flat Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low iron flat glass is a specialized type of glass that is manufactured with minimal iron oxide content, resulting in superior clarity and color neutrality. There are two main types of low iron flat glass on the market: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal surface and then rolling it to achieve the desired thickness. Float glass, on the other hand, is created by floating molten glass on top of a molten tin bath to produce a smooth and uniform sheet of glass.</p></p>
