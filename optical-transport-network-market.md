<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Transport Network Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WDM</li><li>DWDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Transport Network (OTN) refers to a high-speed communication network that uses optical fiber as a medium to transmit large volumes of data. There are various types of OTN markets, with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) being the most commonly used. WDM combines multiple signals onto a single optical fiber by assigning different wavelengths to each signal, thus increasing the capacity of the network. DWDM, on the other hand, further enhances this capacity by using even closer wavelengths, allowing for even more data to be transmitted simultaneously.</p></p>
