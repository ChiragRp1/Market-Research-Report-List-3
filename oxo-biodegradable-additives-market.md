<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxo-Biodegradable Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Particles</li><li>Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxo-biodegradable additives in particle form are small granules that can be easily dispersed in a variety of products, such as plastics and packaging materials. These particles help enhance the biodegradability of the products, making them break down more easily when exposed to the environment. On the other hand, powder form additives offer similar benefits but in a finer, more concentrated form that can be easily mixed into materials during production. Both types of additives contribute to making products more environmentally friendly by accelerating their biodegradation process.</p></p>
