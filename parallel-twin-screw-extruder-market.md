<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parallel Twin Screw Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Co-rotating</li><li>Counter-rotating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parallel Twin Screw Extruder is classified into two main types: Co-rotating and Counter-rotating. Co-rotating extruders have screws that rotate in the same direction, producing high shear and mixing capabilities for various materials. They are commonly used for compounding, mixing, and reacting processes. In contrast, Counter-rotating extruders have screws that rotate in opposite directions, providing more self-wiping and conveying properties. They are typically employed in demanding applications requiring high torque and better self-cleaning characteristics. Both types offer unique advantages and are selected based on specific processing requirements.</p></p>
