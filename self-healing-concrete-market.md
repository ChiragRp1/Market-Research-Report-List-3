<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Healing</li><li>Capsule Based Healing</li><li>Vascular Healing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-healing concrete is a innovative type of concrete that can repair its own cracks without human intervention. There are three main types of self-healing concrete: Intrinsic Healing, Capsule Based Healing, and Vascular Healing. Intrinsic healing involves the use of bacteria or minerals within the concrete to heal cracks. Capsule Based Healing utilizes capsules filled with healing agents that burst open when cracks form. Vascular Healing involves a network of tubes filled with healing agents throughout the concrete to facilitate repair.</p></p>
