<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Virtualization Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud-based</li><li>On-premises</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Server virtualization solutions have two primary market types: cloud-based and on-premises. Cloud-based solutions involve hosting virtual servers on a remote infrastructure, allowing businesses to access and manage their virtual resources via the internet. On-premises solutions, on the other hand, involve implementing virtualization technology within a company's own data center or servers, providing them full control and management over their virtualized environment. Both market types offer benefits, such as flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, but differ in terms of deployment and management methods.</p></p>
