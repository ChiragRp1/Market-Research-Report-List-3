<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Screwed Anchor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suture screwed anchor market is categorized into two types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable anchors are made from materials that break down over time within the body. They are designed to be absorbed by the body, eliminating the need for a separate removal procedure. Non-absorbable anchors, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not break down and are meant to provide long-term stability. They require a separate removal procedure if needed. The choice between absorbable and non-absorbable anchors depends on the specific surgical requirements and patient factors.</p></p>
