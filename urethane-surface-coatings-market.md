<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urethane Surface Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Solvent-Borne</li><li>Water-Borne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urethane surface coatings are available in three main types: powder coatings, solvent-borne coatings, and water-borne coatings. </p><p>Powder coatings are applied as a dry powder and then heated to form a smooth, durable finish. Solvent-borne coatings contain organic solvents that evaporate during the curing process. Water-borne coatings use water as a carrier for the coating material, making them more environmentally friendly compared to solvent-borne coatings. Each type of coating has its own distinct advantages and is chosen based on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
